# Projects
here i will be attempting to embark on a personal project for the aims of creating a portfolio.
i will be analysing public datasets with python and R for different reasons

1. DNA/RNA/Protein Toolkit 
What it is: A collection of simple scripts that perform fundamental molecular biology tasks.
- Calculate GC content.
- Transcribe it into an RNA sequence.
- Find the reverse complement.
- Translate the RNA sequence into an amino acid sequence using the standard codon table.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a Public Dataset
What it is: Find an interesting biological dataset and just explore it. Your goal isn't to make a groundbreaking discovery, but to practice cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data.
- A Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown file walking through your steps.
- Data cleaning: Handling missing values.
- Summary statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation of relevant columns.
- Visualizations: Create plots like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to answer simple questions (e.g., "Does the expression of Gene X differ between healthy and tumor samples?"). Use libraries like Matplotlib/Seaborn (Python) or ggplot2 (R).

3. Personal coursework in school for R and Python examinations and reports.
